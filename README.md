# Password Generator

## Description

This application enables employees or anyone to generate secure random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The application uses four criteria based on lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters to create passwords with a minimum length of 8 and a maximum of 128. This app will run in the browser and will features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters selected among the [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

My objectives for this application is based on the following user story and acceptance criteria;

### User Story

## Usage

The application consists of a text area and a button to generate a password. On clicking the generate password button, the user is presented with a series of prompts that asks for the password's length, and what characters to include. If the user makes any invalid selection such as choosing a length less than the minimum allowable length, the application presents a validation message to guide the user. 

Once a valid criteria is obtained, the application presents the user with a password strictly based on the criteria provided. The user may select the new password to copy for their purposes. The webpage is also designed for different screen sizes and is very responsive.

If an invalid length is entered, the application displays a validation message with adequate information to guide the user to enter a valid length. ![A validation message gets displayed if an invalid password length](./assets/images/length-validation.jpg)

The application proceeds to request for the addition of other criteria based on the acceptance requirements. ![Application presents four criteria prompts for the user to select](./assets/images/criteria-prompt.jpg)

If the user selected an insufficient number of requirements, the application presents the user with feedback guiding the user's next attempt. The minimum is 1 by default but can be varied. ![A validation message gets presented if an invalid number of criteria is selected](./assets/images/criteria-validation.jpg)

The application alerts the user with the new password generated. It shows all the user's requirements it used to generate the password. ![Application presents an alert with new password generated](./assets/images/password-alert.jpg)

The application then presents the user the password in the text area. ![Application displays new password to user](./assets/images/password-display.jpg)
